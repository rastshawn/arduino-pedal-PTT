# arduino-pedal-PTT

Connect a push-button or on-off switch (I used a piano keyboard pedal) to
digital pin 4 on the arduino, and connect an indicator LED to pin 2.

Upload the code to the Arduino.

Then, open Processing and run the sketch. 

You can create an executatble file for your OS by exporting the sketch
as an Application within Processing.
